# Python Projects - Basic
Welcome to my Python repository for Dev160 - Python I.<br/> 
Each project focuses on different aspects of Python, from basic scripts to more complex algorithms.


# Skills
Upon completion of this course, I understand how to:<br/>

• Plan, design, and test an application using an integrated development environment.<br/>
• Create applications using the language's syntax and document the application using comments.<br/>
• Declare and use variables with the language's built-in datatypes, built-in functions, and
understand their scope.<br/>
• Use appropriate arithmetic, logical and comparison operators to develop complex expressions.<br/>
• Use "If" statements and expressions to implement selection structures.<br/>
• Use the "For" and "While" statements to invoke repetition structures.<br/>
• Design programs that invoke and define functions utilizing input parameters and return values
and store user-defined functions in modules.<br/>
• Create and use a collection of data items as set by the data structures for the scripting language.<br/>
